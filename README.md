# circumplexus

A script originally used in [the shape of things](http://circumplex.us/) quiz to generate designs that can be printed on paper and folded into three-dimensional objects. The original project was designed to generate unique shapes based on answers to a personality quiz.

The current scope of this project aims to allow users to design their own shapes.
